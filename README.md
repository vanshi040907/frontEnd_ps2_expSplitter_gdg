# frontEnd_ps2_expSplitter_gdg
This project is the second problem statement for induction in the frontend webdev domain in GDG club of IIT INDORE. <br>
It includes developing a an expense splitter that can perform the following basic functions:<br>
1. Create a group with multiple members.<br>
2. Add expenses with:<br>
       Expense name<br> 
       Amount<br>
       Person who paid<br>
       People involved in the expense<br>
3. Automatically calculate:
       Total amount spent by each person<br>
       Net balance (how much each person owes or is owed)<br>
4. Display a clear summary of settlements.
5. Persist all data using localStorage so that data is not lost on refresh.<br><br>
In this project, i have created the signup page and further the login page if the user has already signed up once using local storage <br>
The user can create and save the groups that they can access later without creating them again and again.<br>
First of after adding up the needed bills the users can see all the bills that they have paid. Now, they can either view the settlements or go back to add more bills.<br>
Even after viewing up the settlements the user can add or delete the bill using change bills button.<br>
