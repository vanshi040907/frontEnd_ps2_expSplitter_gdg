This project is the second problem statement for induction in the frontend webdev domain in GDG club of IIT INDORE. <br>
It includes developing a an expense splitter that can perform the following basic functions:<br>
1. Create a group with multiple members.<br>
2. Add expenses with:<br>
       Expense name<br> 
       Amount<br>
       Person who paid<br>
       People involved in the expense<br>
3. Automatically calculate:
       Total amount spent by each person<br>
       Net balance (how much each person owes or is owed)<br>
4. Display a clear summary of settlements.
5. Persist all data using localStorage so that data is not lost on refresh.<br><br>
Starting with the details, first I have created the page where the features of the website are shown using a slider and then from there the user will get the option to get the demo or sign up.<br>

The user can create and save the groups that they can access later without creating them again and again.<br>

After adding up the needed bills the users can see all the bills that they have paid using Complete and view bills button.</br><img width="761" height="827" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-28 215919" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a198f603-7637-43ad-b1bc-548f7ca29b4d" />
 Now, they can either view the settlements or go back to add more bills.<br><img width="461" height="830" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-28 220033" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/164f6a96-8097-493e-9549-83744c65ba85" />
